With 2 inches per standard deviation, ~85% heritability, 


Superfusion: How China and America Became One Economy and Why the World’s Prosperity Depends on It:

Yao had essentially been bred. Both his parents played basketball. His 6’2 [different height from Wikipedia -Razib] mother, Fang Fengdi, perhaps the tallest woman in China, had been married to an even taller man. She had served as a Red Guard during the height of the Cultural Revolution and had been an ardent Maoist. She enthusiastically participated in the glorious plan of the local government to use her and her husband to produce a sports superstar. The Shanghai authorities who encouraged the match had gone back several generations to ensure that size was embedded in the bloodline. The result was Yao, a baby behemoth who just kept getting bigger.

The revelations in Operation Yao Ming, by former Newsweek journalist Brook Larmer, are likely to raise further disquiet over China's Soviet-style sports system ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Larmer said Yao, China's first successful basketball export and its most famous face worldwide, was the product of a harsh and antiquated program which has changed little since it was set up more than 50 years ago under Mao Zedong.

Larmer says Yao's birth had been anticipated for decades by communist officials - desperate to boost national pride through sports - who had been tracking his family for two generations.

He describes a system where doctors armed with special growth-predicting manuals measure youngsters' bones and pubic hair to identify future athletes. Weightlifters must be squat with strong torsos; divers need tiny hips to minimise splash; basketball players must simply be tall.

"It's no accident that there have been generations of players who have continued to get taller," he said. "One of the first NBA scouts was blown away when he went to northern China and saw more than 20 seven-footers [213cm]."


"But sport is such a visible, exciting measure for China's position in the world, and national feeling is so strong, I don't think that's going to be easy to give up. Gold medals have become an addiction. How do you kick the habit when you've reached the top?"

“We had been looking forward to the arrival of Yao Ming for three generations,” says Wang Chongguang, a retired Shanghai coach who played with Yao’s father in the 1970s and would coach Yao himself in the ’90s. “That’s why I thought his name should be Yao Panpan.” Long-Awaited Yao….

The responsibility for arranging marriages among the most gifted retired athletes often fell to the coaches. “We had to do a lot of work as matchmakers,” says Wang Yongfang, the former sports-institute leader


Shanghai coaches teased the two towering centers that they were made for each other. But it was up to a team leader named Liu Shiyu to make the match. He spoke with the players separately and convinced them that they could “make do” with each other—adding that they had the Communist Party’s stamp of approval to do so. Given such high-level interest, how could Da Fang and Da Yao refuse?


Maybe 1 Yao was enough - he did the job of normalizing Chinese sportsmen? https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/when-yao-ming-was-the-center-of-the-world
